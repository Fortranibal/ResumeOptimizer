  "job_description": "Engineer I/II, R&D\nJob Ref: 5062071003 | Type: Regular\n\nApply for this job\nAbout The Role\nABOUT ROCKET LAB\n\nRocket Lab is a global leader in launch and space systems. The rockets and satellites we build and launch enable some of the most ambitious and vital space missions globally, supporting scientific exploration, Earth observation and missions to combat climate change, national security, and exciting new technology demonstrations. Our Electron rocket has provided reliable access to orbit since 2018, becoming one of the most frequently launched rockets in the world. Neutron will be our next rocket on the launch pad, an advanced 13-tonne payload class, reusable rocket to launch the mega constellations of the future. Our space systems business includes our extensive line of satellites and components that have enabled more than 1,700 missions including the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA Psyche Mission, Artemis I, Mars Ingenuity helicopter, and more.  \n\nJoin our pioneering team and launch your career to new heights!\n\n\n\nSPACE SYSTEMS\n\nRocket Lab’s Space Systems team is responsible for every satellite and satellite component made by Rocket Lab: from complete satellites destined for missions to the Moon and Mars, to the individual components and subsystems that make up a satellite like solar panels, flight software, reaction wheels and star trackers, separation systems, radios, and more. Our Space Systems team is made up of engineers, technicians, and designers who design, create, and put together our own satellites for missions across the commercial, government, and defense sectors, or who build and assemble satellite hardware and software that supports other satellite missions.\n\nR&D ENGINEER I/II\n\nBased out of Rocket Lab's site in Albuquerque, NM, the R&D Engineer I/II participates in the development of new solar array components, technology, and manufacturing methods.  This person will first become closely familiar with the products we make and methods we use to make them, then work collaboratively with production engineers and other R&D engineers of various disciplines to create new products and new manufacturing processes to advance the state of the art.
